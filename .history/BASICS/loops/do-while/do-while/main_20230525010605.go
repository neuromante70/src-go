/*
There is no do-while loop in Go. To emulate the C/Java code
do {
	work();
} while (condition);

you may use a for loop in one of these ways:

1) skip the init and post statemens
next := true
for next = condition {
	work()
}

2) To ensure that it executes at least once, the <condition> must be true for the first iteration and be dependent on the loop stop condition in subsequent iterations. For this we use a BOOL variable:

classic for loop:
for <initialization>; <condition>; <post-condition>
do-while loop
for next := true; next; next=<condition> {
	<loopBody>
}

3) There is also a simpler form of the do-while loop in Go, in which the <condition> of the for loop is checked after the <loopBody> and if it is not true the loop is exited:

for {
	<loopBody>
	if !<condition> { // if condition is not true
		break
	}
}

	for next := true; next; next = i <= 5 {
		fmt.Println(i)
		i++
